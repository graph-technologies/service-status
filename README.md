  - Every 5 minutes, a workflow visits our services to make sure they're up
  - Response time is recorded every 6 hours and committed to git
  - Graphs of response time are generated every day
- GitHub Issues is used for incident reports
  - An issue is opened if an endpoint is down
  - Issues are closed automatically when the site comes back up
- GitHub Pages is used for the status website
  - A simple, beautiful, and accessible PWA is generated
  - Fetches data from this repository using the GitHub API
